	>CASSINI MISSION
	file: cassini_image.jpg
	caption: This still is from a short computer-animated film that highlights Cassini's accomplishments at Saturn and reveals the science-packed final orbits.
		
		>OVERVIEW

		The team made a major effort to summarize the mission. +Volume 1 contains the science component:+ ^Mission Overview, Science Objectives and Results^ while technical information is contained in additional volumes archived at the Jet Propulsion Lab.
		
		Mission Science Highlights and Science Objectives Assessment provides a brief overview of the mission

		+Look for data in a variety of ways:+
		*By mission science area below
		*By instrument below, or start with the +Instrument Comparison+
		*If you know what you are looking for, use the +Commonly Used Resources and Tools+ list +An Explanation of Cassini C-Kernels+
		*To help interpret data, use the +Spacecraft Events and Configuration Information+ page to find sources of noise and other ancillary information

		>MISSION SCIENCE AREAS
		[
		{
		+Saturn Planet and Atmosphere+
		+Saturn's Rings+
		+Magnetospheric+
		+Icy Satellites, Enceladus, and Other Moons+

		{
		Science includes Saturn's formation and evolution, interior fundamentals, atmospheric properties, global circulation and dynamics, auroral observations, ionosphere and magneticfields.
            Science includes the configuration and process responsible for ring structure, composition, relationships with satellites, and interactions with Saturn's magnetosphere, ionosphere and atmosphere.
		Science includes the configuration of Saturn's magnetic field, distribution of charged particles in the magnetosphere, Saturn's aurorae, and Titan's interaction with the magnetospheric plasma.
		Science includes the study of Enceladus, other icy satellites such as Dione, small moons such as Phoebe, and the ring-moon relationships.
		Science includes atmosphere, rings and moons data collected during the Cassini flyby of Jupiter.
