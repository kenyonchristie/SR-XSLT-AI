                <title>MISSION OVERVIEW</title>
                <para>The twin Voyager spacecraft, over the course of a dozen years, drew back the
                    curtain on nearly half of the solar system. From launch in 1977 through the
                    spectacular parting shots of Neptune at the outer reaches of the solar system in
                    1989, this pair of spacecraft explored four planets -- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus
                    and Neptune -- as well as dozens of moons, and the rings andmagnetic
                    environments of those planetary systems.</para>
                <para>The Voyagers were designed to take advantage of a rare geometric arrangement
                    of the outer planets that occurs only once every 176 years. This configuration
                    allows a single spacecraft to swing by all four gas giants without the need for
                    large onboard propulsion systems; the flyby of each planet both accelerates the
                    spacecraft and bends its flight path. Without these gravityassists, the flight
                    time to Neptune would have been 30 years.</para>
                <para>The second of the two Voyager spacecraft, Voyager 2, was launched first, on 20
                    August 1977. It was followed on 5 September 1977 by Voyager 1, which was put on
                    a faster, shorter trajectory to Jupiter. Both launches took place from the
                    CapeCanaveral Air Force Station in Florida.</para>
                <para>Eighteen months after launch, Voyager 1 reached Jupiter, 650 million
                    kilometers away. The spacecraft made its closest approach on 5 March 1979, while
                    Voyager 2 followed on 9 July of the same year. Images streamed back from the
                    pair of spacecraft showing the complex, swirling turbulence of Jupiter's
                    atmosphere in exquisite detail. A giant storm, three times the size of Earth,
                    raged in Jupiter's upper atmosphere, surrounded by rippling currents that
                    rotated about it.</para>
                <para>Voyager 1 found nine active volcanoes erupting on Io, the innermost of
                    Jupiter's four major moons. Four months later, Voyager 2 found that eight of the
                    nine volcanoes were still active. A thin, dusty ring was also discovered around
                    Jupiter, forcing revision of theories about origins and mechanics of planetary
                    ring systems.</para>

                    <title>VOYAGER 1 LAUNCH</title>
                    <para>The launch vehicle for Voyager 1 was a Titan/Centaur. The first stage
                        Titan was powered by both solid and liquid fuel engines. The Centaur stage,
                        20 meters long and 3 meters in diameter burned a fuel combination of liquid
                        hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The Titan boosted the Voyager Centaur
                        combination into low Earth orbit, and the Centaur plus a small solid fuel
                        rocket provided the energy for Voyager 1 to escape Earth orbit.</para>

                    <para>The Voyager 1 flyby of Jupiter took place on 5 March 1979 at 12:04:36 UTC
                        with the spacecraft closest approach only 348890 kilometers from the center
                        of Jupiter. Among the highlights of the encounter were the discovery of a
                        faint ring and one new satellite. Satellite encounter information is given
                        below; 'UNK' denotes 'unknown' at time of this writing. The Voyager 1
