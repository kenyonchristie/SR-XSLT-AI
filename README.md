# **SR-XSLT-AI**
## **CSC450 - Senior Research Project**

### **Purpose**

My project endeavors to test 4 different AI code assistants against XML/XSLT code generation. It will test their ability to accurately translate sample text with brief schema information into a valid XML, and it will test their ability to provide usable XLST code to transform that XML into a PDF. The purpose for this research is to see if AI assistants are a viable tool in assisting XML and XSLT development.

### **Methodology**

The 4 AI code assistants chosen are:
>
>- ChatGPT
>
>- Github Copilot
>
>- Notion AI
>
>- You.com->Code
> 
The IDE selected is:
>
>- Oxygen Editor 
>
Basic testing plan:
>- Multiple scripts to be developed
>
>- Scripts to be submitted to the chosen AI assistants
>
>- AI responses to be copied and pasted into Oxygen Editor xml and xsl templates
>
>- Transforms to be executed 
>
>- Any developer intervention required to get to PDF to be documented
>
### **Results**

Results will be measured against the following criteria:
>
>- Is the generated XML document well-formed?
>
>- Is it schema compliant?
>
>- Does it contain accurate content, with no duplication or droppage?
>
>- Is the transformation successful without developer intervention?
>
>- If not, how much developer intervention was required to get to PDF?
>
>- Is the resulting PDF compliant with the specifications requested?
>
