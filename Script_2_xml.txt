Rules:

1. The root element is content
2. The second level element wrapping all of below data is description
2. Items starting with > are titles and the > character is not included in the xml output
3. Every title block is wrapped in a levelledPara element with a unique id attribute that begins with 'lp-' and ends with sequential numbering starting with 0001
4. Every paragraph indented under a title is a para element that is a child of the same levelledPara as its corresponding title
5. Items beginning with * are randomList elements with listItemPrefix attribute value of "pf07" and the * character is not included in the xml output
6. Items enclosed with + are emphasis elements with emphasisType attribute value of "em01" and the + character is not included in the xml output
7. Items enclosed with ^ are emphasis elements with emphasisType attribute value of "em02" and the ^ character is not included in the xml output
8. Data enclosed in [] is a two-column cals-table with no borders, and each block enclosed in {} represents a column. Column one is 3.5in wide and column two is 3.5in wide. Neighter [] nor {} characters are included in the xml output
9. Table elements have a unique id attribute that begins with 'tbl-' and ends with sequential numbering starting with 0001
10. Items preceded by # are sequentialList elements and the # character is not included in the xml output

		>OVERVIEW

		The team made a major effort to summarize the mission. +Volume 1 contains the science component:+ ^Mission Overview, Science Objectives and Results^ while technical information is contained in additional volumes archived at the Jet Propulsion Lab.
		
		Mission Science Highlights and Science Objectives Assessment provides a brief overview of the mission

		+Look for data in a variety of ways:+
		*By mission science area below
		*By instrument below, or start with the +Instrument Comparison+
		*If you know what you are looking for, use the +Commonly Used Resources and Tools+ list +An Explanation of Cassini C-Kernels+
		*To help interpret data, use the +Spacecraft Events and Configuration Information+ page to find sources of noise and other ancillary information

		Science includes Saturn's formation and evolution, interior fundamentals, atmospheric properties, global circulation and dynamics, auroral observations, ionosphere and magneticfields.
            Science includes the configuration and process responsible for ring structure, composition, relationships with satellites, and interactions with Saturn's magnetosphere, ionosphere and atmosphere.
		Science includes the configuration of Saturn's magnetic field, distribution of charged particles in the magnetosphere, Saturn's aurorae, and Titan's interaction with the magnetospheric plasma.
		Science includes the study of Enceladus, other icy satellites such as Dione, small moons such as Phoebe, and the ring-moon relationships.
		Science includes atmosphere, rings and moons data collected during the Cassini flyby of Jupiter.
